I've got the map showing up, added infrastructure so that each tile knows its coordinate and tile type.
The next thing that should be done is implementing a pathfinding AI that can reach the endpoint.




	TODO:
implement basic unit object (literally just a sphere)
units should, wherever they spawn, attempt to seek the exit point

implement turrets
implement stats for units, so that they can take damage
