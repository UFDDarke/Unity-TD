I've got the map showing up, added infrastructure so that each tile knows its coordinate and tile type.
The next thing that should be done is implementing a pathfinding AI that can reach the endpoint.

		Managed to upload the project to GitHub, very very nice.
		I've converted the LevelManager class to a static class. Now I just need to call its initialization script and we should be back to regular functionality.
		I'm partially done with basic enemy implementation, but I will need to work on the level manager initialization first.
		TODO for today:
		Add basic main menu with which to start the game.
		Create a unity editor script to create enemies.


	TODO:
implement basic unit object (literally just a sphere)
units should, wherever they spawn, attempt to seek the exit point

implement turrets
implement stats for units, so that they can take damage
